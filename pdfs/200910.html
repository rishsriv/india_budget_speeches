                  with a renewed mandate. As Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh,

                  Members would appreciate that a single Budget Speech cannot
                  solve all our problems, nor is the Union Budget the only
                  instrument to do so. Yet, it is an important means to share
                  the vision of the Government, particularly as we begin a new
                  term. I propose to do just that for the next hour or so, as I

                  </span>Madam Speaker, at the time of the presentation of the
                  Interim Budget, I had given a detailed analysis of the
                  economic situation. Without repeating myself, I would like to
                  highlight that the development course charted by the UPA
                  Government in the last five years has been possible due to a
                  step up in the growth rate of the economy and improved revenue
                  buoyancy. The principal growth driver in this period has been
                  private investment, which has been predominantly funded by
                  domestic resources. During the year 2008-09, there has been a
                  dip in the growth rate of GDP from an average of over 9 per
                  cent in the previous three fiscal years to 6.7 per cent. It
                  has affected the pace of job creation in certain sectors of
                  the economy and the investment sentiments of the business
                  community. It has also resulted in considerably lower revenue
                  growth for the government. Another feature of the year 2008-09
                  was a sharp rise in the wholesale price index to nearly 13% in
                  August 2008 and an equally sharp fall close to 0% in March
                  2009. While a detailed analysis of the developments has been
                  presented in the Economic Survey-2008-09, tabled in both
                  houses of Parliament last Thursday, I draw your attention to a
                  few aspects.</p>

                  External trade and external capital flows are an important
                  part of the economy and so is the contribution of the services
                  sector to the <st1:stockticker w:st="on">
                  GDP</st1:stockticker>
                  at well over 50 per cent. The share of merchandise trade
                  (exports plus imports) as a proportion of <st1:stockticker w:st="on">
                  GDP</st1:stockticker>
                  has more than doubled over the past decade to 38.9 per cent in
                  2008-09. Similarly, trade in goods and services taken together
                  has also doubled to 47 per cent during this period. Gross
                  capital flows rose to a peak of over 9 per cent of <st1:stockticker w:st="on">
                  GDP</st1:stockticker>
                  in 2007-08 before falling in the wake of the global financial
                  crisis. The significant increase in the inflow of foreign
                  capital is important, not so much for bridging the domestic
                  savings-investment gap, but for facilitating the
                  intermediation of financial resources to meet the growing
                  needs of the economy.</p>

                  </span>This growing integration of the Indian economy with the
                  rest of the world has brought new opportunities and also new
                  challenges. It has made the task of sustaining high growth
                  more complex. Over the past month, we have critically
                  evaluated Government’s efforts at both short term economic
                  recovery as well as medium term economic growth. The economic
                  recovery and growth is a cooperative effort of the Central and

                  </span>To counter the negative fallout of the global slowdown
                  on the Indian economy, the Government responded by providing
                  three focused fiscal stimulus packages in the form of tax
                  relief to boost demand and increased expenditure on public
                  projects to create employment and public assets. The RBI took
                  a number of monetary easing and liquidity enhancing measures
                  to facilitate flow of funds from the financial system to meet
                  the needs of productive sectors.</p>

                  fiscal deficit from 2.7 per cent in 2007-08 to 6.2 per cent of

                  in 2008-09. The difference between the actuals of 2007-08 and
                  2008-09 constituted the total fiscal stimulus. This fiscal
                  stimulus at 3.5% of <st1:stockticker w:st="on">

                  signs of revival in the domestic industry and the foreign
                  investors have also returned to the Indian market in the last
                  couple of months. It is possible that the two worst quarters
                  since the global financial meltdown in September 2008 are
                  behind us. While the global financial conditions have shown
                  improvement over the recent months, uncertainties relating to
                  the revival of the global economy remain. We cannot,
                  therefore, afford to drop our guard. We have to continue our

                  (JNNURM) has been an important instrument for refocusing the
                  attention of the State governments on the importance of urban
                  infrastructure. In recognition of the role of JNNURM, the
                  allocation for this scheme is being stepped up by 87 per cent
                  to Rs.12,887 crore in the current budget. To improve the lot
                  of the urban poor, I propose to enhance the allocation for
                  housing and provision of basic amenities to urban poor to
                  Rs.3,973 crore in the current year’s budget. This includes
                  the provision for Rajiv Awas Yojana (RAY), a new scheme
                  announced in the address of the President of India. This
                  scheme, the parameters of which are being worked out, is
                  intended to make the country slum free in the five year

                  </span>Madam Speaker, Honourable Members are aware that global
                  prices of oil and petroleum products had shot up to
                  unprecedented levels in 2008-09. Most oil importing countries,
                  including our neighbours, adjusted their domestic prices to
                  reflect these global changes. Though prices have declined
                  since then, they are already about double of the lows reached
                  in the wake of the global financial crisis. It is important to
                  recognise that, with almost three-quarters of our oil
                  consumption met through imports, domestic prices of petrol and
                  diesel have to be broadly in sync with global prices of these
                  items. Government will set up an expert group to advise on a
                  viable and sustainable system of pricing petroleum products.
                  Details will be announced by my colleague, the Minister of
                  Petroleum and Natural Gas.</p>

                  </span>It is time that we complete the process that was
                  started in 1991 for building a trust based, simple, neutral,
                  tax system with almost no exemptions and low rates designed to
                  promote voluntary compliance. The Income Tax Return Forms
                  should be simple and user-friendly. I have asked the
                  Department to work on SARAL-II forms for early introduction.
                  We need a tax system which generates revenues on a sustained
                  basis without use of coercive tax collection methods at the
                  end of each year to meet targets. It is my intention to make a
                  modest start in this direction in the current year and ensure
                  that the process is completed in the next four years. At the
                  end of this process, I hope the Finance Minister can credibly
                  say that our tax collectors are like honey bees collecting
                  nectar from the flowers without disturbing them, but spreading
                  their pollen so that all flowers can thrive and bear fruit.</p>

                  merit of this balanced approach has been borne out in the
                  recent experience, as the turbulence in the world financial
                  markets has left the Indian banking and financial sector
                  relatively unaffected. Never before has Indira Gandhi’s bold
                  decision to nationalise our banking system exactly 40 years
                  ago - on 14th of July, 1969 - appeared as wise and visionary
                  as it has over the past few months. Her approach continues to
                  be our inspiration even as we introduce competition and new

                  crore towards Non Plan and Rs.3,25,149 crore towards Plan

                  34%. The total increase in expenditure in 2009-10 over BE

                  </span>The increase in Non Plan expenditure is mainly on
                  account of the implementation of the Sixth Central Pay
                  Commission recommendations, increased food subsidy and higher
                  interest payment arising out of the larger fiscal deficit in
                  2008-09. Interest payments are estimated at Rs.2,25,511 crore
                  constituting about 36% of Non Plan revenue expenditure in BE
                  2009-10. The total provision for subsidies are up from

                  </span>Honourable Members may recall that while presenting the
                  Interim Budget 2009-10, I had stated that the Plan expenditure
                  for 2009-10 may have to be increased further as a part of
                  counter-cyclical measures to minimise the impact of global
                  recession and economic slowdown. Against the backdrop of
                  limited fiscal space because of reduction in CENVAT and
                  Service Tax rates, Government have taken a conscious and bold
                  decision to enhance the Gross Budgetary Support (GBS) for the
                  Annual Plan 2009-10 by Rs.40,000 crore over Interim Budget
                  2009-10. Bulk of this enhanced GBS is directed towards public
                  investment in infrastructure with special emphasis on rural
                  infrastructure, raising growth potential and leading to income
                  generation. Besides, the State Governments will be permitted
                  to borrow additional 0.5% of their GSDP by relaxing the fiscal
                  deficit target under FRBM from 3.5% to 4% of their GSDP. This
                  will enable the State Governments to raise additional open
                  market loans of about Rs.21,000 crore in the current year. In
                  other words, the total additionality in Plan expenditure by
                  Centre and the States put together would be Rs.61,000 crore
                  over Interim Budget. I do believe that this fiscal expansion
                  will go a long way in reversing the impact of economic
                  slowdown and accelerate our growth revival in the medium term.</p>

                  </span>Madam Speaker, given the possibility of the economic

                  </span>The non tax revenue receipts are, however, likely to be

                  </span>The revenue deficit as a percentage of GDP is projected

                  provisional accounts of 2008-09. The fiscal deficit as a

                  a matter of concern and Government will address this issue in

                  cannot resist the temptation of re-visiting Kautilya. He said

                  becomes due. Just as one does not collect unripe fruits, he
                  shall avoid taking wealth that is not due because that will

                  </span>As the House is aware, the thrust of reforms over the
                  last few years, including the previous term of this
                  Government, has been to improve the efficiency and equity of
                  our tax system. This is sought to be achieved by eliminating
                  distortions in the tax structure, introducing moderate levels
                  of taxation and expanding the base. These policy changes have
                  been accompanied by requisite re-engineering of key business
                  processes coupled with automation, both for direct and
                  indirect taxes. On the direct tax side, a recent initiative
                  for further improving efficiency is the setting up of a
                  Centralized Processing Centre (CPC) at Bengaluru where all
                  electronically filed returns, and paper returns filed in
                  entire Karnataka, will be processed.</p>

                  </span>These tax reform initiatives have produced impressive

                  healthy growth in tax revenues over the last five years is
                  essentially attributable to growth in direct taxes. Further,
                  the share of direct taxes in the Centre’s tax revenues has
                  increased to 56 per cent in 2008-09 from 41 per cent in
                  2003-04, reflecting a sharp improvement in the equity of our
                  tax system.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
                  Government is committed to furthering this process of tax

                  excise duties as well as service tax. I must hasten to add

                  an export-orientation have been adversely impacted by the
                  demand compression in global markets. Presently, exporters of

                  goods are permitted to import raw materials, consumables etc.
                  upto 3 per cent of the fob value of their exports free of
                  duty. I propose to add a few more items to these lists. Full

                  announced a series of fiscal stimulus packages, one of the key
                  elements of which was the sharp reduction in the ad valorem
                  rates of Central Excise duty for non-petroleum products by 4
                  percentage points across the board on 7th of December 2008 and

                  </span>One of the consequences of these cuts was that pure
                  cotton textiles came to be fully exempted from excise duty. We
                  have received representations that full exemption prevents
                  manufacturers from availing of export rebate of the duty paid
                  from CENVAT credit. I propose to rectify this situation by

                  </span>Ever since the revamp of the excise duty structure on
                  textiles by my distinguished predecessor in the 2004 budget, a

                  sector and the manmade sector. In keeping with the integrity
                  of the earlier structure, I propose to restore the rate of 8
                  per cent Central Excise duty on manmade fibre and yarn on a
                  mandatory basis and on stages beyond fibre and yarn at that
                  rate on optional basis. These changes, together with duty
                  changes on intermediates, would imply that the duty on all
                  types of manmade fibre and yarn and their intermediates would
                  be the same, easing the problem of credit accumulation.</p>

                  </span>In the goods transport sector, service tax is currently
                  levied on transport of goods by road, by air, through
                  pipelines and in containers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
                  </span>However, goods carried by Indian railways or those
                  carried as coastal cargo or through inland waterways are not
                  charged to service tax.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  </span>In order to provide a level playing field in the goods
                  transport sector, I propose to extend the levy of service tax
                  to these modes of goods transport.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
                  </span>The new levy is not likely to impact the prices of
                  essential commodities or goods for mass consumption, as
                  suitable exemptions would be provided.</p>
                  <p class="textmatter" style="margin-bottom:11.5pt;line-height:16.1pt"><b>133.</b><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  </span>As the Hon’ble Members are aware, services provided
                  by chartered accountants, cost accountants, and company
                  secretaries as well as by engineering and management
                  consultants are presently charged to service tax.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
                  </span>Although there is a school of thought that legal
                  consultants do not provide any service to their client, I hold
                  my distinguished predecessor in high esteem and disagree!<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
                  </span>As such, I propose to extend service tax on advice,
                  consultancy or technical assistance provided in the field of
                  law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This tax
                  would not be applicable in case the service provider or the
                  service receiver is an individual.</p>

                  </span>Vehicles having ‘Stage Carriage Permits’ and run by
                  State undertakings are exempted from service tax. However,
                  transportation of passengers undertaken by private enterprises
                  in vehicles having ‘Contract Carriage Permits’ is,
                  subjected to service tax.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
                  </span>In order to bring parity in tax treatment, I propose to
                  exempt such transportation also from the levy of service tax.</p>

                  </span>In July, 2008 goods transport agents (GTA) went on
                  strike with several demands.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
                  </span>One of the demands that was accepted by the government
                  was to exempt certain services, such as packing, cargo
                  handling and warehousing, provided to GTAs en route, from
                  service tax.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For
                  this purpose an exemption notification was issued. It was also
                  demanded by goods transport agents that the proceedings
                  already initiated against such service providers should be
                  dropped.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
                  Government has accepted this genuine demand. Therefore, I
                  propose to make certain legislative changes required to
                  fulfill this promise.</p>

                  what we will have to do. With strong hearts, enlightened minds
                  and willing hands, we will have to overcome all odds and
