                <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I. THE ECONOMY: AN OVERVIEW</font></p>
                <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2. Honourable Members! The India growth story, so far, has been an
                absorbing and inspiring tale. Beginning January 1, 2005, the economy has recorded a growth
                rate of over 8 per cent in 12 successive quarters up to December 31, 2007. In the first
                three years of the UPA Government, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) increased by 7.5 per
                cent, 9.4 per cent and 9.6 per cent, resulting in an unprecedented average growth rate of
                8.8 per cent. In the current year too, according to the Advance Estimates by the Central
                Statistical Organisation (CSO), the growth rate will be 8.7 per cent - although I am
                confident that we will maintain the average of 8.8 per cent. The drivers of growth
                continue to be "services" and "manufacturing", which are estimated to
                grow at 10.7 per cent and 9.4 per cent, respectively.</font> </p>
                <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3. Nevertheless, 2007-08 has been the most challenging of the last four
                years. At the beginning of the year, the outlook for the global economy was benign. Our
                economy, thanks to our own policies as well as globalisation, was poised to record another
                year of high growth: in fact, the first half of 2007-08 returned a growth of 9.1 per cent.
                However, since August 2007, the financial markets in the developed countries have
                witnessed considerable turbulence that has not yet abated. The consequences for developing
                countries are also not yet clear.</font></p>
                <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">4. Moreover, agriculture has struck a disappointing note. Despite a
                fine start in the first half of 2007-08, the growth rate for the whole year in agriculture
                is estimated at only 2.6 per cent.</font></p>
                <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">5. There are other downside risks too. World prices of crude oil,
                commodities and food grains have risen sharply in the period April 2007 to January 2008.
                The position of crude oil is well known to this House. Among commodities, the prices of
                iron ore, copper, lead, tin, urea etc are elevated. The prices of wheat and rice have
                increased in the world market by 88 per cent and 15 per cent, respectively. All these
                trends are inflationary, and there is pressure on domestic prices, especially on the
                prices of food articles. Consequently, the management of the supply side of food articles
                will be the most crucial task in the ensuing year.</font> </p>
                <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">6. We have also witnessed capital inflows that are far in excess of the
                current account deficit. This poses a challenge to monetary management. The solution lies
                in increasing the absorptive capacity of the economy in the medium term. In the short
                term, it is our responsibility to manage the flows more actively. Government will, in
                consultation with the RBI, continue to monitor the situation closely and take such
                temporary measures as may be necessary to moderate the capital flows consistent with the
                objective of monetary and financial stability.</font> </p>
                <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">7. Keeping inflation under check is one of the cornerstones of our
                policy. Recently, the Prime Minister declared, "I think no Government in our country
                can be oblivious to the objective of ensuring reasonable price stability without hurting
                the growth process." There can be no clearer enunciation of policy. However, since
                the downside risks have increased worldwide, we must be vigilant and prepared to make
                swift adjustments in our policies to achieve the goal of growth with price stability.</font></p>
                <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">8. Let me first deal with agriculture, briefly for the present, and at
                some length later. The Ministry of Agriculture has estimated that the total output of food
                grains in 2007-08 will be 219.32 million tonnes and that will be an all time record. In
                particular, production of rice is estimated at 94.08 million tonnes; maize at 16.78
                million tonnes; soya bean at 9.45 million tonnes; and cotton at 23.38 million bales (of
                170 kg each) - and each of these will be an all time record. Government is conscious that
                while a lot has been done, a lot more needs to be done. Since the last Budget, Government
                has formulated and announced the National Policy for Farmers. Besides, Government has
                launched the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana with an outlay of Rs.25,000 crore and the
                National Food Security Mission with an outlay of Rs.4,882 crore. Both schemes will be
                implemented during the Eleventh Five Year Plan period. We are determined to become
                self-sufficient in food grains. Presently, I shall place before this House a number of new
                initiatives in the agriculture sector.</font></p>

                <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">9. To return to the India growth story, I am of the firm belief that we
                owe our sustained progress to the policy of economic reforms first ushered in by a
                Congress Government and now carried forward by the UPA Government.</font></p>

                UPA Government had declared in the National Common Minimum Programme its intention to make
                growth more inclusive. Sir, I ask this House, respectfully, to judge our record on

                slim volume titled "Indira Gandhi - Selected Sayings". Within minutes, I found
                this gem and I quote, "The more one does, the more one attempts, the more one is
                capable of doing". What I have narrated so far is indeed proof of more inclusive
                growth, but if you ask me "can we do better?", my answer would be "we can
                and we should." Budget 2008-09 is about raising our sights and doing more and doing
                better.</font></p>

                <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">THE CRUCIAL SECOND YEAR</font></p>
                <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">13. The Eleventh Plan has started on a note of robust growth. Never
                before did we start a Plan with a first year growth rate of 8.7 per cent. Government
                regards the second year of the Plan as extremely critical to the success of the Plan.
                2008-09 should be a year of consolidation; of securing the ongoing programmes on firm
                financial foundations; of close monitoring of implementation and enforcing accountability;
                and of measuring the outcomes in terms of the targets achieved as well as their quality.
                The Plan documents assumed that the Gross Budgetary Support (GBS) in the second year would
                be Rs.228,725 crore. In our view, that will not be enough. Hence, I propose to increase
                the GBS to Rs.243,386 crore, which will represent an increase of Rs.38,286 crore over the
                allocation in 2007-08.</font> </p>

                Considering the fact that there are over 30 lakh SHGs credit-linked to banks, I propose to

                the scheme and cover all women SHGs that are credit-linked to banks. Since one-half of the

                Rs.10,000 crore to be used for Plan capital expenditure. This money - under Plan 'B' -
                will be available to ministries/departments of the Central Government and to State

                in agriculture, I think that we need an ambitious scheme of a much larger proportion.
                Government is of the view that massive investments are required to be made in irrigation
                projects. Recently, Government has approved 14 projects that satisfy certain criteria as
                national projects and three of them alone would require Rs.7,000 crore during the Eleventh
                Plan period. Having regard to the magnitude of the challenge, I propose to establish the
                Irrigation and Water Resources Finance Corporation (IWRFC) with an initial capital of
                Rs.100 crore contributed by the Central Government. State Governments and other financial
                institutions will be invited to contribute to the equity. It is our intention to mobilise
                the very large resources that will be required to fund major and medium irrigation
                projects. I hope to be able to incorporate IWRFC as a company before March 31, 2008.</font> </p>

                listed above will give a boost to the agriculture sector, the question that still looms
                large is what we should do about the indebtedness of farmers. Honourable members will
                recall that Government had appointed a Committee under Dr. R. Radhakrishna to examine all
                aspects of agricultural indebtedness. The Committee has since submitted its report and it
                is in the public domain. The Committee had made a number of recommendations but stopped
                short of recommending waiver of agricultural loans. However, Government is conscious of
                the dimensions of the problem and is sensitive to the difficulties of the farming
                community, especially the small and marginal farmers. Having carefully weighed the pros
                and cons of debt waiver and having taken into account the resource position, I place
                before this House a scheme of debt waiver and debt relief for farmers:</font> </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <blockquote>

                      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(i) All agricultural loans disbursed by scheduled commercial banks,
                      regional rural banks and cooperative credit institutions up to March 31, 2007 and overdue
                      as on December 31, 2007 will be covered under the scheme.</font></p>
                      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(ii) For marginal farmers (i.e., holding upto 1 hectare) and small
                      farmers (1-2 hectare), there will be a complete waiver of all loans that were overdue on
                      December 31, 2007 and which remained unpaid until February 29, 2008. In respect of other
                      farmers, there will be a one time settlement (OTS) scheme for all loans that were overdue
                      on December 31, 2007 and which remained unpaid until February 29, 2008. Under the OTS, a
                      rebate of 25 per cent will be given against payment of the balance of 75 per cent.</font> </p>
                      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(iii) Agricultural loans were restructured and rescheduled by banks in
                      2004 and 2006 through special packages. These rescheduled loans, and other loans
                      rescheduled in the normal course as per RBI guidelines, will also be eligible either for a
                      waiver or an OTS on the same pattern.</font> </p>
                      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(iv) The implementation of the debt waiver and debt relief scheme will
                      be completed by June 30, 2008. Upon being granted debt waiver or signing an agreement for
                      debt relief under the OTS, the farmer would be entitled to fresh agricultural loans from
                      the banks in accordance with normal rules.</font> </p>
                      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(v) Government estimates that about three crore small and marginal
                      farmers and about one crore other farmers will benefit from the scheme. The total value of
                      overdue loans being waived is estimated at Rs.50,000 crore and the OTS relief on the
                      overdue loans is estimated at Rs.10,000 crore.</font></p>

                Two indicators tell the story. The saving rate and the investment rate in 2003-04 were

                Advisory Council to the Prime Minister, they will be 35.6 per cent and 36.3 per cent,
                respectively, by the end of 2007-08. The trend is reflected on the foreign investment side
                too. During the period April-December 2007-08, foreign direct investment amounted to
                US$12.7 billion and foreign institutional investment to US$18 billion. Our policy is to

                six core infrastructure industries as well as in the overall index of industrial
                production for the period April-December 2007-08. The decline has been somewhat sharp in
                the case of consumer goods, especially consumer durables. The silver lining is that the
                growth in capital goods is still very high at 20.2 per cent, indicating that industry
                continues to make huge capital investments and has a positive outlook about the future.
                Manufacturing industries that have grown more slowly than the average include food
                products, cotton textiles, textile products including apparel, paper and transport
                equipment. Among the reasons for the moderation are a rise in interest rates and the
                appreciation of the Rupee. There are limits to monetary policy accommodation, especially
                when the need is to maintain price stability. However, some steps can be taken on the
                fiscal side and I shall, presently, place before the House some proposals in order to
                stimulate industrial growth. Our goal is to take the manufacturing growth rate to a double
                digit. This will also call for more reforms in the coal and electricity sectors as well as

                sanctioned after April 1, 2008 from Rs.25,000 to Rs.35,000 in plain areas and from
                Rs.27,500 to Rs.38,500 in hill/difficult areas. The subsidy for upgradation of houses will
                be increased from Rs.12,500 per unit to Rs.15,000. A beneficiary will still need own funds
                to complete the house. Public sector banks will be advised to include IAY houses under the
                differential rate of interest (DRI) scheme and lend up to Rs.20,000 per unit at an
                interest rate of 4 per cent.</font> </p>

                and identify the measures that we may have to take in the future. Work is in progress.
                Even while adhering to the principle of "common but differentiated
                responsibility" we can - and we must - do a number of things in our self-interest. We
                can promote clean technology products; we can review fuel emission and efficiency
                regulations; we can replace wood by solar as the fuel of common use; we can encourage the
                use of gas which is the most benign hydrocarbon; we can set up a trading platform for
                carbon emissions; we can build sustainable greenfield cities; and we can do more. In order

                attention to outcomes as we do to outlays; or to physical targets as we do to financial
                targets; or to quality as we do to quantity. Government therefore proposes to put in place
                a Central Plan Schemes Monitoring System (CPSMS) that will be implemented as a Plan scheme

                has improved tremendously. I am happy to report that the revenue deficit for the current
                year will be 1.4 per cent (against a BE of 1.5 per cent) and the fiscal deficit will be
                3.1 per cent (against a BE of 3.3 per cent).</font> </p>
                <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">121. Further progress will be made in 2008-09. The revenue receipts of
                the Central Government for 2008-09 are projected at Rs.602,935 crore and the revenue
                expenditure at Rs.658,119 crore. Consequently, the revenue deficit is estimated at
                Rs.55,184 crore, which amounts to 1.0 per cent of GDP. The fiscal deficit is estimated at
                Rs.133,287 crore which is 2.5 per cent of GDP. Honourable Members will note that not only
                will I achieve the target for fiscal deficit under the FRBM Act, I have also left for
                myself some headroom. In the case of revenue deficit, I will meet the target of annual
                reduction of 0.5 per cent. However, because of the conscious shift in expenditure in
                favour of health, education and the social sector, we may need one more year to eliminate
                the revenue deficit. In my view, this is an entirely acceptable deferment.</font> </p>

                <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">124. Many people are surprised by the buoyancy in tax revenues,
                especially in direct taxes. I am not. I have always maintained that moderate and stable
                tax rates coupled with a tax administration that shows no fear or favour will bring high
                revenues to the exchequer.</font> </p>

                in a lighter vein, having a lucky Finance Minister may have also helped! We are on course
                to achieve the Budget Estimates of indirect taxes and exceed the Budget Estimates of

                <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">128. The peak rate for non-agricultural products was 20 per cent in
                January 2004 and now stands at 10 per cent. The collection rate is the closest
                approximation to the level of protection to domestic industry, and that rate for all
                imports stood at 10 per cent in 2006-07. Since April 2007, the Rupee has appreciated
                against the Dollar by 9.8 per cent. Consequently, the case for reducing the peak rate at
                this stage is very weak. Hence, I propose to make no change in the peak rate of customs
                duty.</font></p>

                State Governments, the rate of Central Sales Tax was reduced from 4 per cent to 3 per cent
                in this financial year. It is now proposed to reduce the rate to 2 per cent from April 1,
                2008. Consultations are underway on the compensation for losses, if any, and once
                agreement is reached the new rate will be notified. I am also happy to report that there
                is considerable progress in preparing a roadmap for introducing the Goods and Services Tax
                with effect from April 1, 2010.</font> </p>

                <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">184. Mr. Speaker, Sir, once upon a time India, together with China,
                accounted for 50 per cent of the world's output. We must regain our position and it is
                within our capacity to do so.</font> </p>
                <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">185. Our work in Government is, every day and every hour, a discovery
                of the path to reach our goals: full employment, abolition of poverty and elimination of
                inequality. "These goals can only be achieved by a considerable increase in national
                income and our economic policy must, therefore, aim at plenty and equitable distribution.
                We must produce wealth, and then divide it equitably. How can we have a welfare state
                without wealth?" Those are not my words; they were uttered in 1955 by Pandit
                Jawaharlal Nehru. Although Jawaharlal Nehru did not use the phrase inclusive growth, he
                actually spelt out the conditions for inclusive growth.</font></p>
                <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">186. Those words will guide the UPA Government. As always, I turned to
                my muse, Saint Tiruvalluvar, for guidance and reassurance. 2,000 years ago he set the
                benchmark for good governance in the following immortal words:</font></p>

                <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We have tried to remain true to this philosophy. The four years to
                2007-08 have been the best years so far but, may I say with humility, that the best is yet
                to come.</font></p>
