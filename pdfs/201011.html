                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 2009, when I
                presented the interim Budget in February and the regular Budget in July in this august
                House, the Indian economy was facing grave uncertainties. Growth had started decelerating
                and the business sentiment was weak. The economy's capacity to sustain high growth was
                under serious threat from the widespread economic slowdown in the developed world. </p>

                the policy makers in many other countries, how this crisis would eventually unfold. What
                would be its impact on the growth momentum of the Indian economy?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>How soon will we be able to turnaround the fortunes
                of our economy? The short term global outlook was bleak and the consensus was that year
                2009 would face the brunt of this crisis across the world.</p>

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At home, there was added
                uncertainty on account of the delayed and sub-normal south-west monsoon, which had
                undermined the kharif crop in the country.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There
                were concerns about production and prices of food items and its possible repercussions on
                the growth of rural demand.</p>

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Today, as I stand before you, I
                can say with confidence that we have weathered these crises well. Indian economy now is in
                a far better position than it was a year ago. That is not to say that the challenges today
                are any less than what they were nine months ago when UPA under the leadership of Mrs
                Sonia Gandhi was elected back to power and Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh formed the
                Government for the second term. </p>

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The three challenges and the
                medium term perspective that I had outlined in my last Budget Speech remain relevant, even
                today. These would continue to engage the Indian policy-planners for the next few years. </p>
                <p class="textmatter" style="line-height:normal"><b>6.</b><span style="mso-tab-count:

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <i>first </i>challenge before
                us is to quickly revert to the high GDP growth path of 9 per cent and then find the means
                to cross the 'double digit growth barrier'. This calls for imparting a fresh momentum to
                the impressive recovery in growth witnessed in the past few months. In this endeavour, I
                seek Lord Indra's help to make the recovery more broad-based in the coming months. </p>
                <p class="textmatter" style="line-height:normal"><b>7.</b><span style="mso-tab-count:

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Growth is only as important as
                what it enables us to do and be. Therefore, the <i>second </i>challenge is to harness
                economic growth to consolidate the recent gains in making development more inclusive. The
                thrust imparted to the development of infrastructure in rural areas has to be pursued to
                achieve the desired objectives within a fixed time frame. </p>
                <p class="textmatter" style="line-height:normal"><b>8.</b><span style="mso-tab-count:

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We have to strengthen food
                security, improve education opportunities and provide health facilities at the level of
                households, both in rural and urban areas. These are issues that require significant
                resources, and we have to find those resources. </p>
                <p class="textmatter" style="line-height:normal"><b>9.</b><span style="mso-tab-count:
1">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <i>third </i>challenge relates
                to the weaknesses in government systems, structures and institutions at different levels
                of governance. Indeed, in the coming years, if there is one factor that can hold us back
                in realising our potential as a modern nation, it is the bottleneck of our public delivery
                mechanisms. There have been many initiatives in this regard, in different sectors, at
                different points of time. Some of them have been effective in reforming the way the
                Government works in those areas. But we have a long way to go before we can rest on this
                count. </p>

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Union Budget cannot be a mere statement of
                Government accounts. It has to reflect the Government's vision and signal the policies to

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With development and economic reforms, the
                focus of economic activity has shifted towards the non-governmental actors, bringing into
                sharper focus the role of Government as an enabler.</p>

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An enabling Government does not try to deliver
                directly to the citizens everything that they need. Instead it creates an enabling ethos
                so that individual enterprise and creativity can flourish. Government concentrates on

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yesterday, I laid on the table of the House
                the Economic Survey, which gives a detailed analysis of the economic situation of the
                country over the past twelve months.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>I intend
                to highlight only a few salient features that form the backdrop of this Budget. </p>
                <p class="textmatter" style="line-height:normal"><b>15.</b><span style="mso-tab-count:1">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The fiscal year 2009-10 was a challenging year
                for the Indian economy. The significant deceleration in the second half of 2008-09,
                brought the real GDP growth down to 6.7 per cent, from an average of over 9 per cent in
                the preceding three years. We were among the first few countries in the world to implement
                a broad-based counter-cyclic policy package to respond to the negative fallout of the
                global slowdown. It included a substantial fiscal expansion along with liberal monetary
                policy support. </p>
                <p class="textmatter" style="line-height:normal"><b>16.</b><span style="mso-tab-count:1">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The effectiveness of these policy measures
                became evident with fast paced recovery. The economy stabilised in the first quarter of
                2009-10 itself, when it clocked a GDP growth of 6.1 per cent, as against 5.8 per cent in
                the fourth quarter of the preceding year. It registered a strong rebound in the second
                quarter, when the growth rate rose to 7.9 per cent. With the Advance Estimates placing the
                likely growth for 2009-10 at 7.2 per cent, we are indeed vindicated in our policy stand.
                The final figure may well turn out to be higher when the third and fourth quarter GDP
                estimates for 2009-10 become available. </p>
                <p class="textmatter" style="line-height:normal"><b>17.</b><span style="mso-tab-count:1">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This recovery is very encouraging for it has
                come about despite a negative growth in the agriculture sector.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>More importantly, it is the result of a renewed
                momentum in the manufacturing sector and marks the rise of this sector as the growth
                driver of the economy. The growth rate in manufacturing in December 2009 was 18.5 per cent—
                the highest in the past two decades. There are also signs of a turnaround in the
                merchandise exports with a positive growth in November and December 2009 after a decline
                of about twelve successive months. Export figures for January are also encouraging.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Significant private investment can now be expected
                to provide the engine for sustaining a growth of 9 per cent per annum. With some luck, I
                hope to breach the 10 per cent mark in not-too-distant a future. </p>
                <p class="textmatter" style="line-height:normal"><b>18.</b><span style="mso-tab-count:1">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A major concern during the second half of
                2009-10 has been the emergence of double digit food inflation. There was a momentum in
                food prices since the flare-up of global commodity prices preceding the financial crisis
                in 2008, but it was expected that the agriculture season beginning June 2009 would help in
                moderating the food inflation. However, the erratic monsoons and drought like conditions
                in large parts of the country reinforced the supply side bottlenecks in some of the
                essential commodities. This set in motion inflationary expectations. Since December 2009,
                there have been indications of these high food prices, together with the gradual hardening
